    Attributes:
        max_epsilon_per_query (float):
            Optional. The maximum epsilon value that a
            query can consume. If the subscriber specifies
            epsilon as a parameter in a SELECT query, it
            must be less than or equal to this value. The
            epsilon parameter controls the amount of noise
            that is added to the groups â€” a higher epsilon
            means less noise.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_epsilon_per_query``.
        delta_per_query (float):
            Optional. The delta value that is used per
            query. Delta represents the probability that any
            row will fail to be epsilon differentially
            private. Indicates the risk associated with
            exposing aggregate rows in the result of a
            query.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_delta_per_query``.
        max_groups_contributed (int):
            Optional. The maximum groups contributed
            value that is used per query. Represents the
            maximum number of groups to which each protected
            entity can contribute. Changing this value does
            not improve or worsen privacy. The best value
            for accuracy and utility depends on the query
            and data.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_groups_contributed``.
        privacy_unit_column (str):
            Optional. The privacy unit column associated
            with this policy. Differential privacy policies
            can only have one privacy unit column per data
            source object (table, view).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_privacy_unit_column``.
        epsilon_budget (float):
            Optional. The total epsilon budget for all
            queries against the privacy-protected view. Each
            subscriber query against this view charges the
            amount of epsilon they request in their query.
            If there is sufficient budget, then the
            subscriber query attempts to complete. It might
            still fail due to other reasons, in which case
            the charge is refunded. If there is insufficient
            budget the query is rejected. There might be
            multiple charge attempts if a single query
            references multiple views. In this case there
            must be sufficient budget for all charges or the
            query is rejected and charges are refunded in
            best effort. The budget does not have a refresh
            policy and can only be updated via ALTER VIEW or
            circumvented by creating a new view that can be
            queried with a fresh budget.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_epsilon_budget``.
        delta_budget (float):
            Optional. The total delta budget for all queries against the
            privacy-protected view. Each subscriber query against this
            view charges the amount of delta that is pre-defined by the
            contributor through the privacy policy delta_per_query
            field. If there is sufficient budget, then the subscriber
            query attempts to complete. It might still fail due to other
            reasons, in which case the charge is refunded. If there is
            insufficient budget the query is rejected. There might be
            multiple charge attempts if a single query references
            multiple views. In this case there must be sufficient budget
            for all charges or the query is rejected and charges are
            refunded in best effort. The budget does not have a refresh

            Output only. The epsilon budget remaining. If
